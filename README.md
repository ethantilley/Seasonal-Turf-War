# Seasonal Turf War (Game Jam)

In this game, 'Seasonal Turf War', you and up to 3 other players are represented as one of each season, you battle it out in a free for all, where you throw each off the maps and hurl projectiles at each-other to claim the most ground you tread on. The player with the most turf at the end of the level wins.
In the game, there's a join game level that's more for you to get used to the controls and figure out who's who, you don't have to connect where - you're able to join at any time throughout the game.
